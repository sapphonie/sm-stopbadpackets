THIS DOES NOT NEED TO EXIST with the TF2 update on 07/07/22

```
- Added a game server setting, "net_chan_limit_msec", which allows server operators to limit amount of processing time the game server can spend on processing packets for each client per tick. Clients that send packets causing server CPU processing time to exceed configured number of milliseconds will be kicked from the game server.
- Added a game server setting, "net_chan_stats_dump" which, when enabled, will dump statistics of each network channel when that network channel is closed. Statistics include messages, bandwidth, and CPU processing time breakdown.
```

SORRY!

Used to combat server lagger bs / cheats fucking with network packets in all source engines.
